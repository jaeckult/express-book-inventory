Build a REST API with Express.js to manage a collection of books. The API should support the following CRUD operations:

GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books.
POST /books: Add a new book with a title and author (both required).
PUT /books/:id: Update a bookâ€™s status to "read" or "unread" (status must be provided).
DELETE /books/:id: Remove a book by its ID.
